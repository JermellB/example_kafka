# do a pip install kafka-python before you start
# Install assumes a default local install of kafka with a topic created called test. Via the docs up to this point https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#quickstart_createtopic
# then you should be able to cd to example_kafka/kafka_ex/src
# then run python main.py

# A log file will be generated, has what kafka is doing as well as messages sent.

# stdout should generate the squares

# if you wait 30 seconds the program will log that it's killing itself and quit.


#this highlights my local concurrency skills and cloud parallelization skills in python.
